INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT
Ch1. Innovative Management
----------------  

Management is the art of getting things done through people.
As a manager, your job is to create the
environment and conditions that engage other people in goal accomplishment.

Management is the attainment of organizational goals in an effective and effi -
cient manner through planning, organizing, leading, and controlling organizational
resources.

This definition holds two important ideas: (1) the four functions of planning, organizing,
leading, and controlling, and (2) the attainment of organizational goals in an
effective and effi cient manner.

Planning.
Planning means identifying goals for future organizational performance and deciding
on the tasks and use of resources needed to attain them. In other words, managerial
planning defines where the organization wants to be in the future and how to get there.

Organizing
Organizing typically follows planning and reflects how the organization tries to
accomplish the plan. Organizing involves assigning tasks, grouping tasks into departments,
delegating authority, and allocating resources across the organization.

Leading
Leading is the use of influence to motivate employees
to achieve organizational goals.
Leading involves motivating entire departments and
divisions as well as those individuals working immediately
with the manager.


Controlling
Controlling means
monitoring employees' activities, determining whether the organization is on target
toward its goals, and making corrections as necessary.

Ch6. Managerial Planning and Goal Setting
---------------- 

Goals and plans enhance employees'
motivation and commitment by reducing uncertainty and clarifying what they
should accomplish. Lack of a clear goal can hamper motivation because people
don’t understand what they’re working toward


p195


Goals should be specific and measurable.
Vague goals have a little motivating power for employees.
Goals should be challenging but realistic.
When goals are unrealistic, they set employees up for failure and lead to a decrease in employee morale.
Goals should be linked with rewards. Reward people when they meet goals.
 
 
 
SMART
S for  Specific (What exactly do we need; definite and precise goals)
M for Measurable (How we are going to measure it (expressed in quantitative terms))
A for Attainable (The goal must be realistic)
R for Relevant (What results can realistically be achieved, given available resources)
T for Time-bound (We expect growth for the next year, month or any other time period)
 
 
Methods by Objectives (MBO)
MBO is the system where managers and employees together define goals.
 
1. Set goals (Corporate, Departmental, Individual). MBO implies that every employee should take part in it, but maybe it should be only key workers.
2. Develop action plans.
3. Review progress and make corrections periodically if something goes wrong or circumstances have changed.
4. Appraise overall performance. It shapes goals for the next period and allows rewards.
 
 
Single-Use Plans
Plans that are developed to achieve a set of goals that are unlikely to be repeated in the future.
There are two kind of SUP:
Programs - great plans for several years, large in scope. May be associated with several projects.
Project - smaller and shorter than program. Little undertaking.
 
Standing Plans
Plans that provide guidance for tasks and situation that occur repeatedly within organization.
Standing plans generally pertain to such matters as employee illness, absences, smoking, discipline, hiring and dismissal. And sometimes the use of emails.
Policies (broad in scope), rules (narrow in scope, defines how specific action should be performed) and procedures (defines series of steps to attain certain goal).

p.203

Contingency plans define company responses to be taken in the case of emergencies and unexpected conditions.
After defining the most probable negative events the scenarios are built for them. Typically there are several scenarios for each factor, ranging from the most optimistic to 
the most pessimistic view. Building scenarios allows to act fast when something happens due to it was predicted and a plan was created.

How to handle crisis when it occurs.
1. Designate a crisis management team and spokeperson
2. Prepare a plan that management team should perform.
3. Set up an effective communication system

There are two approaches to planning.
1. Centralized planning. (Waterfall).
Has that disadvantage that may be inaproppriate in fast-paced environment.
2. Decentralized planning involves everyone in organization in the planning process. Employees become more commited following their own plans.
Planning experts work directly with line managers and front-line employees.


Stretch goals
2. Performance dashboards. So everyone could see the progress.

Sometimes you need to shame your employees to cheer them up. (not too often. Once in three months)

PLANNING 
Ch7. Strategy Formulation and Implementation
---------------- 

Strategic management refers to the set of decisions and actions used to formulate
and execute strategies that will provide a competitively superior fit between the
organization and its environment so as to achieve organizational goals.

Strategy is a plan of allocating resources for achieving organizational goals.
Strategy is changing over time to fit environmental conditions.
Competitive advantage is a thing that distincts organization from other companies.

Core competence is an activity that company does particularly well in comparison to competitors.


Strategic management is the set of decisions and actions used to formulate and execute strategies that will provide advantages comparing to competitors.
To formulate these decisions one must understand what changes and trends are occurring?
Who are our customers? Who are our competitors?


Strategy is a plan of action that describes resource allocation to gain competitive advantage and attaining the organization's goals.
Competitive advantage refers to what sets the organization apart from others and provides it
with a distinctive edge for meeting customer or client needs in the marketplace.
Usually it's an accessibility to different resources (channels of distribution, technologies, logistics) allowing company to make it's product cheaper, better. 

Core competency is something that company does especially well in comparison to it's competitors.
Core competency must not be easy to imitate.
A core competence may be in the area of superior research and development, expert technological know-how, process effi ciency, or exceptional customer service.

Core competence may be in providing a superior service for large group meetings (for hotels), in focusing on high quality in a limited product line.


Sometimes results of joint efforts surpass sum of results of separate parts.


Vertical integration is the company expansion to businesses that produce supplies to their core business or go to distribution directly.
1) Wine company buyes bottle factory to reduce costs by making cheaper bottles.
2) Apple opened it's own stores to sell iPhones, iPads and iSoOn  
 
 
Porter five forces
1) Threat of new entrants
The question is how difficult to enter new market. Because there may be some barriers like patents, great amount of money, government policy, access to distribution and so on.
2) Threat of substitutes
There are threats of two kinds: substitute in the same field (Pepsi and Coca-Cola) and substitute from another field (sugar and sugar substitute, train and plane)
3) Bargaining power of customers
Bargaining power of customers is great when customers have alternatives.
4) Bargaining power of suppliers
Ex. 1 supplyer many customers.
 
For company to stay on the competetive edge Porter proposes to use one of three strategies:
1. Differentiation. Something that allows to customer to distinguish your product. 
It may be achieved by advertising, distinctive product features, exceptional service.
2. Cost leadership. This strategy uses tight cost controls to make product more cheap.
But sometimes people prefer the product not watching the price. They may buy it for it's reputation. 
The product gives feeling of belonging to elite. Apple products are the good example.
3. Focus. This strategy is based on focusing on specific region or buyer group.
Company will use differentiation or cost leadership but only for narrow target market.
 
 
Globalization. Helps save millions on marketing by using single all-over-the-world strategy.
Ex. MacDonalds and Coca-Cola.

Multidomestic strategy. Design, marketing and advertising change from country to country to fit indigenous culture.
Ex. The beauty standarts vary. Asians prize white smooth skin, while europeans like tanned skin.
Africans prefer to see black people in ads. Frenchmen don't drink orange juice on breakfast. And so on.


After the new strategy has been set it should be implemented. It's the most difficult part.
1. Leadership
You need to convince people, motivate them, use your country cultural values to persuade managers to follow the strategy.
There might be public speeches, building coalitions of people who support new ideas, personal persuasion of middle management.

Clear, measurable goals and rewards that are tied to implementation efforts are also important
for gaining commitment.


2. Structural Design.
We need to set manager's responsibilities. The degree of their authority. The consolidation of facilities and departments.	
Many new strategies require making changes in organizational structure: adding/changing positions, reorganizing the teams, 
shifting manager's responsibilities and accountabilities (отчетность).
 
 
3. Information and control systems.
These systems help management to see what is going on. Collecting data helps managers predict future trends.

4. Human resources.
When designing structure of orgainization you may need new people who have skills to fit new strategy.
Also cross-training employees may help, that enables them to perform a variety of functions.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tips for Effective Strategy Execution
 
1. Build commitment to the strategy
Managers make a great effort to make front-line managers to understand the new direction. 
Clear, measurable goals and rewards that are tied to implementation efforts are also important
for gaining commitment. 
 
2. Devise a clear execution plan.

Without such a plan, managers and staff are likely to lose sight of the new strategy 
when they return to the everyday demands of their jobs. For successful execution, translate
the strategy into a simple, streamlined plan that breaks the implementation process into a
series of short-term actions, with a timetable for each step.

Everybody should be aware of how success will be measured and tracked, what resources will be required
and how they will be allocated.

4. Know your employees' knowledge and skills.
People from your organization may already have all required skills to fit new strategy.
So there is no need to search for people from somewhere else.
Also some training may be useful to add some skills.

5. Communication
Managers should know how things are going, identify problems, and keep people informed about the
organization’s progress. Barriers should be broken for effective communication.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

SWOT-analysis is about to understand companies Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O), Threats (T).
S and W refers to internal environment, thus company may impact them.
O and T refers to external environment, thus company has no impact to them.

Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
Weaknesses: characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others
Opportunities: elements that the project could exploit to its advantage
Threats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project

PLANNING
Ch8. Managerial Decision Making
---------------- 

Decision making is the process of identifying problems and opportunities and then resolving them.
Programmed decisions are decisions for situations that occur often enough and it is possible to develop rules
that may be applied in the future.


Nonprogrammed decisions are made in response to situations that are unique,
are poorly defined and largely unstructured, and have important consequences for the organization. 
Many nonprogrammed decisions involve strategic planning because uncertainty is
great and decisions are complex.


p.248


There are three strategies of decision making:
1. Classical model is based on rational economic assumptions and manager beliefs about what ideal decision should be.
There are 4 assumptions underlying this model:
a. Problems are precisely formulated and defined. The goals are known and agreed on.
b. All alternatives and the potential results of each are calculated.
c. There is a criteria for decisions. For example, no losses allowed.
d. The decision maker is rational and uses logic.

Decision makers should be more rational and not rely entirely on personal preference in making decisions.
The guidelines can be created. Thus classical model is about programmed decisions.

2. Administrative model
In case of uncertainty and ambiguity manager's rationality has bounds. 
Organization and circumstances may be extremely complex. So managers
have the time and ability to process only a limited amount of information with which to make decisions.

In such case manager finds the first satisficing decision and don't waste time on further searches.
Even if the better decision exists it may not fit because of time and expense of obtaining complete information.
Assumptions of administrative model:
a. Decision goals are vague and conflicting. Managers can't come up with adjusted decision.
Problems and opportunities are unknown.
b. Rational procedures are not always used because they can't capture the complexity of challenge.
c. Manager's resources are limited because of human, information, resource constraints.
d. Managers settle for a satisficing rather than a maximizing solution, partly
because they have limited information and partly because they have only vague
criteria for what constitutes a maximizing solution.


So here comes intuition. It represents a quick apprehension of a decision situation based on past experience but
without conscious thought.
Managers need to take a balanced approach by considering both rationality and intuition as important components of effective
decision making.


p.252

3. Political model
When making big decisions it's hard for managers to come up with common decision.
Political model is about making coalitions.
Political model assumptions: 
a. Organizations are made up of groups with diverse interests, goals, and values. Managers disagree about problem priorities and may not understand or share the goals and interests of other managers.
b. Information is ambiguous and incomplete. The attempt to be rational is limited by the complexity of many problems as well as personal and organizational constraints.
c. Managers do not have the time, resources, or mental capacity to identify all dimensions
of the problem and process all relevant information. Managers talk to each
other and exchange viewpoints to gather information and reduce ambiguity.
d. Managers engage in the push and pull of debate to decide goals and discuss alternatives.
Decisions are the result of bargaining and discussion among coalition
members.


Decision making process:
1. Recognition of Decision Requirement
Decision should be made when organizational goals have not been achieved. The results are below expectations.

2. Diagnosis and Analysis of Causes
When problem is recognized it is time to know when and where it has occurred?
How it occurred? What is the urgency of the problem?

3. Development of Alternatives
In highly uncertain environment managers may come up only with one or two solutions that satisfice.
But some studies find that limiting the search for alternatives is a primary cause of decision failure in organizations.


4. Selection of Desired Alternative
Select one of developed alternatives.

5. Implementation of Chosen Alternative
Similar to strategy execution in chapter 7.
Managers should believe in what they are doing. That increases commitment of their employees.


6. Evaluation and Feedback
Gathering the information that tells how well decision is implemented.



Decision making styles.
1. Directive style. 
The directive style is used by people who prefer simple, clear-cut solutions to problems.
Managers who use this style often make decisions quickly because they do
not like to deal with a lot of information and may consider only one or two alternatives.
People who prefer the directive style generally are efficient and rational
and prefer to rely on existing rules or procedures for making decisions.

2. Analytical style.
Managers with an analytical style like to consider complex solutions based on as
much data as they can gather. These individuals carefully consider alternatives
and often base their decisions on objective, rational data from management control
systems and other sources. They search for the best possible decision based on
the information available.

3. Conceptual style.
People who tend toward a conceptual style also like to consider a broad amount of
information. However, they are more socially oriented than those with an analytical
style and like to talk to others about the problem and possible alternatives for
solving it. Managers using a conceptual style consider many broad alternatives,
rely on information from both people and systems, and like to solve problems
creatively.

4. Behavioral style.
The behavioral style is often the style adopted by managers having a deep concern
for others as individuals. Managers using this style like to talk to people one-onone
and understand their feelings about the problem and the effect of a given decision on them.


Reasons of bad decisions:
1. Being influenced by initial impressions.
2. Justifying past decisions.
It is hard to close failed project if millions were poured in it.
3. Seeing what you want to see.
It is good to have a devil's advocate that will show other options or make you sure you're doing right.
4. Perpetuating the status quo. Managers may base decisions on what has worked
in the past and fail to explore new options, dig for additional information, or
investigate new technologies.
5. Framing of the problem. 
E.g. gain 100k with 100% chance and gain 600k with 33% chance.
Or lose 500k with 100% chance and lose 400k with 67% chance.
The choice depends on how problem is set.
6. Overconfidence
When uncertainty is high, managers
may unrealistically expect that they can successfully predict outcomes and hence
select the wrong alternative.


Evidence-based management.
1. Demand evidence.
Fake customers in the shop. Fake calls to support.
2. Five Whys
The first why generally produces a superficial explanation. Each subsequent why probes deeper.
3. Do a Post-Mortem.
Continuos learning in the after-action review.


Group decisions.
1. Brainstorming.
People come up with all ideas they got. No critics. Just ideas.
In fact, one study found that when four people are asked to “brainstorm” individually, they typically come up
with twice as many ideas as a group of four brainstorming together.

2. Rigorous Debates
Person vs person debate.
Group vs group debate.

CEO of MicroAge often plays the devil’s advocate, changing his position in the middle of a debate to ensure
that other executives don’t just go along with his opinions

3. Avoid groupthink
Groupthink refers to the tendency of people in groups to suppress contrary opinions. When people slip into groupthink, 
the desire for harmony outweighs concerns over decision quality

4. Know when to retreat.
Don't hide negative information. If it's better to retreat - retreat.

Essentials:

Decision making should involve six basic steps: problem recognition, diagnosis
of causes, development of alternatives, choice of an alternative, implementation
of the alternative, and feedback and evaluation.


Biases to watch out for include being
influenced by initial impressions, trying to correct or justify past flawed decisions,
seeing only what you want to see, perpetuating the status quo, being influenced
by problem framing, and being overconfident.
