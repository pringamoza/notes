Richard Daft - Management.

Ch1.  
 
Management is the art of getting things done through people.
As a manager, your job is to create the
environment and conditions that engage other people in goal accomplishment.

Management is the attainment of organizational goals in an effective and effi -
cient manner through planning, organizing, leading, and controlling organizational
resources.

This definition holds two important ideas: (1) the four functions of planning, organizing,
leading, and controlling, and (2) the attainment of organizational goals in an
effective and effi cient manner.

Planning.
Planning means identifying goals for future organizational performance and deciding
on the tasks and use of resources needed to attain them. In other words, managerial
planning defines where the organization wants to be in the future and how to get there.

Organizing
Organizing typically follows planning and reflects how the organization tries to
accomplish the plan. Organizing involves assigning tasks, grouping tasks into departments,
delegating authority, and allocating resources across the organization.

Leading
Leading is the use of influence to motivate employees
to achieve organizational goals.
Leading involves motivating entire departments and
divisions as well as those individuals working immediately
with the manager.


Controlling
Controlling means
monitoring employees' activities, determining whether the organization is on target
toward its goals, and making corrections as necessary.

Ch6.

Goals and plans enhance employees'
motivation and commitment by reducing uncertainty and clarifying what they
should accomplish. Lack of a clear goal can hamper motivation because people
don’t understand what they’re working toward


p195


Goals should be specific and measurable.
Vague goals have a little motivating power for employees.
Goals should be challenging but realistic.
When goals are unrealistic, they set employees up for failure and lead to a decrease in employee morale.
Goals should be linked with rewards. Reward people when they meet goals.
 
 
 
SMART
S for  Specific (What exactly do we need; definite and precise goals)
M for Measurable (How we are going to measure it (expressed in quantitative terms))
A for Attainable (The goal must be realistic)
R for Relevant (What results can realistically be achieved, given available resources)
T for Time-bound (We expect growth for the next year, month or any other time period)
 
 
Methods by Objectives (MBO)
MBO is the system where managers and employees together define goals.
 
1. Set goals (Corporate, Departmental, Individual). MBO implies that every employee should take part in it, but maybe it should be only key workers.
2. Develop action plans.
3. Review progress and make corrections periodically if something goes wrong or circumstances have changed.
4. Appraise overall performance. It shapes goals for the next period and allows rewards.
 
 
Single-Use Plans
Plans that are developed to achieve a set of goals that are unlikely to be repeated in the future.
There are two kind of SUP:
Programs - great plans for several years, large in scope. May be associated with several projects.
Project - smaller and shorter than program. Little undertaking.
 
Standing Plans
Plans that provide guidance for tasks and situation that occur repeatedly within organization.
Standing plans generally pertain to such matters as employee illness, absences, smoking, discipline, hiring and dismissal. And sometimes the use of emails.
Policies (broad in scope), rules (narrow in scope, defines how specific action should be performed) and procedures (defines series of steps to attain certain goal).

p.203

Contingency plans define company responses to be taken in the case of emergencies and unexpected conditions.
After defining the most probable negative events the scenarios are built for them. Typically there are several scenarios for each factor, ranging from the most optimistic to 
the most pessimistic view. Building scenarios allows to act fast when something happens due to it was predicted and a plan was created.

How to handle crisis when it occurs.
1. Designate a crisis management team and spokeperson
2. Prepare a plan that management team should perform.
3. Set up an effective communication system

There are two approaches to planning.
1. Centralized planning. (Waterfall).
Has that disadvantage that may be inaproppriate in fast-paced environment.
2. Decentralized planning involves everyone in organization in the planning process. Employees become more commited following their own plans.
Planning experts work directly with line managers and front-line employees.


Stretch goals
2. Performance dashboards. So everyone could see the progress.

Sometimes you need to shame your employees to cheer them up. (not too often. Once in three months)

Ch7.

Strategic management refers to the set of decisions and actions used to formulate
and execute strategies that will provide a competitively superior fit between the
organization and its environment so as to achieve organizational goals.

Strategy is a plan of allocating resources for achieving organizational goals.
Strategy is changing over time to fit environmental conditions.
Competitive advantage is a thing that distincts organization from other companies.

Core competence is an activity that company does particularly well in comparison to competitors.


Strategic management is the set of decisions and actions used to formulate and execute strategies that will provide advantages comparing to competitors.
To formulate these decisions one must understand what changes and trends are occurring?
Who are our customers? Who are our competitors?


Strategy is a plan of action that describes resource allocation to gain competitive advantage and attaining the organization's goals.
Competitive advantage refers to what sets the organization apart from others and provides it
with a distinctive edge for meeting customer or client needs in the marketplace.
Usually it's an accessibility to different resources (channels of distribution, technologies, logistics) allowing company to make it's product cheaper, better. 

Core competency is something that company does especially well in comparison to it's competitors.
Core competency must not be easy to imitate.
A core competence may be in the area of superior research and development, expert technological know-how, process effi ciency, or exceptional customer service.

Core competence may be in providing a superior service for large group meetings (for hotels), in focusing on high quality in a limited product line.


Sometimes results of joint efforts surpass sum of results of separate parts.


Vertical integration is the company expansion to businesses that produce supplies to their core business or go to distribution directly.
1) Wine company buyes bottle factory to reduce costs by making cheaper bottles.
2) Apple opened it's own stores to sell iPhones, iPads and iSoOn  
 
 
Porter five forces
1) Threat of new entrants
The question is how difficult to enter new market. Because there may be some barriers like patents, great amount of money, government policy, access to distribution and so on.
2) Threat of substitutes
There are threats of two kinds: substitute in the same field (Pepsi and Coca-Cola) and substitute from another field (sugar and sugar substitute, train and plane)
3) Bargaining power of customers
Bargaining power of customers is great when customers have alternatives.
4) Bargaining power of suppliers
Ex. 1 supplyer many customers.
 
For company to stay on the competetive edge Porter proposes to use one of three strategies:
1. Differentiation. Something that allows to customer to distinguish your product. 
It may be achieved by advertising, distinctive product features, exceptional service.
2. Cost leadership. This strategy uses tight cost controls to make product more cheap.
But sometimes people prefer the product not watching the price. They may buy it for it's reputation. 
The product gives feeling of belonging to elite. Apple products are the good example.
3. Focus. This strategy is based on focusing on specific region or buyer group.
Company will use differentiation or cost leadership but only for narrow target market.
 
 
Globalization. Helps save millions on marketing by using single all-over-the-world strategy.
Ex. MacDonalds and Coca-Cola.

Multidomestic strategy. Design, marketing and advertising change from country to country to fit indigenous culture.
Ex. The beauty standarts vary. Asians prize white smooth skin, while europeans like tanned skin.
Africans prefer to see black people in ads. Frenchmen don't drink orange juice on breakfast. And so on.


After the new strategy has been set it should be implemented. It's the most difficult part.
1. Leadership
You need to convince people, motivate them, use your country cultural values to persuade managers to follow the strategy.
There might be public speeches, building coalitions of people who support new ideas, personal persuasion of middle management.

Clear, measurable goals and rewards that are tied to implementation efforts are also important
for gaining commitment.


2. Structural Design.
We need to set manager's responsibilities. The degree of their authority. The consolidation of facilities and departments.	
Many new strategies require making changes in organizational structure: adding/changing positions, reorganizing the teams, 
shifting manager's responsibilities and accountabilities (отчетность).
 
 
3. Information and control systems.
These systems help management to see what is going on. Collecting data helps managers predict future trends.

4. Human resources.
When designing structure of orgainization you may need new people who have skills to fit new strategy.
Also cross-training employees may help, that enables them to perform a variety of functions.

Tips for Effective Strategy Execution
 
1. Build commitment to the strategy
Managers make a great effort to make front-line managers to understand the new direction. 
Clear, measurable goals and rewards that are tied to implementation efforts are also important
for gaining commitment. 
 
2. Devise a clear execution plan.

Without such a plan, managers and staff are likely to lose sight of the new strategy 
when they return to the everyday demands of their jobs. For successful execution, translate
the strategy into a simple, streamlined plan that breaks the implementation process into a
series of short-term actions, with a timetable for each step.

Everybody should be aware of how success will be measured and tracked, what resources will be required
and how they will be allocated.

4. Know your employees' knowledge and skills.
People from your organization may already have all required skills to fit new strategy.
So there is no need to search for people from somewhere else.
Also some training may be useful to add some skills.

5. Communication
Managers should know how things are going, identify problems, and keep people informed about the
organization’s progress. Barriers should be broken for effective communication.

SWOT-analysis is about to understand companies Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O), Threats (T).
S and W refers to internal environment, thus company may impact them.
O and T refers to external environment, thus company has no impact to them.

Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
Weaknesses: characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others
Opportunities: elements that the project could exploit to its advantage
Threats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project
