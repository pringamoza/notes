Ch1. Intro
PMBOK is recognized as a good practices.
"Good practice" means there is general agreement that the
application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chances of success over many projects.

"Good practice" does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all projects; the
organization and/or project management team is responsible for determining what is appropriate for any given project.


What is a Project?
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary
nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end. The end is reached when the project’s
objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its objectives will not or cannot be met,
or when the need for the project no longer exists. A project may also be terminated if the client (customer, sponsor,
or champion) wishes to terminate the project.

What is Project Management?
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the
project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of
the 47 logically grouped project management processes, which are categorized into five Process Groups. These five
Process Groups are:
• Initiating,
• Planning,
• Executing,
• Monitoring and Controlling, and
• Closing.


p38
A project management office (PMO) is a management structure that standardizes the project-related governance
processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques. The responsibilities of a
PMO can range from providing project management support functions to actually being responsible for the direct
management of one or more projects.
The PMO integrates data and information from corporate strategic projects and evaluates how higher level
strategic objectives are being fulfilled. The PMO is the natural liaison between the organization’s portfolios,
programs, projects, and the corporate measurement systems (e.g. balanced scorecard).

In Management theory (Daft) Project Management's purpose is to overview and coordinate the work of
several departments.

A primary function of a PMO is to support project managers in a variety of ways which may include, but are not
limited to:
• Managing shared resources across all projects administered by the PMO;
• Identifying and developing project management methodology, best practices, and standards;
• Coaching, mentoring, training, and oversight;
• Monitoring compliance with project management standards, policies, procedures, and templates by means
of project audits;
• Developing and managing project policies, procedures, templates, and other shared documentation
(organizational process assets); and
• Coordinating communication across projects.

Relationship Between Project Management, Operations Management, and Organizational Strategy

Operations evolve to support the day-to-day business, and are necessary to achieve strategic and tactical goals of the business.
Operations require business process management.
Changes in business operations may be the focus of a dedicated project — especially if there are substantial
changes to business operations as a result of a new product or service delivery. 

Operations are ongoing endeavors that produce repetitive outputs, with resources assigned to do basically the
same set of tasks according to the standards institutionalized in a product life cycle. Unlike the ongoing nature of
operations, projects are temporary endeavors.

Operations management is an area of management concerned with ongoing production of goods and/or
services. It involves ensuring that business operations continue efficiently by using the optimum resources needed
and meeting customer demands. It is concerned with managing processes that transform inputs (e.g., materials,
components, energy, and labor) into outputs (e.g., products, goods, and/or services).


Operational stakeholders should be engaged and their needs identified as part of the stakeholder register, and
their influence (positive or negative) should be addressed as part of the risk management plan.

The following list includes examples of operational stakeholders (depending upon the business):
Plant operators, Manufacturing line supervisors, Help desk staff, Production system support analysts, 
Customer service representative, Salespersons, Maintenance workers, Telephone sales personnel, 
Call center personnel, Retail workers, Line managers, and Training officers.

Role of the Project Manager

The project manager is the person assigned by the performing organization to lead the team that is responsible
for achieving the project objectives. The role of a project manager is distinct from a functional manager or operations
manager. Typically the functional manager is focused on providing management oversight for a functional or a
business unit, and operations managers are responsible for ensuring that business operations are efficient.

The project manager becomes the link between the strategy and the team.
Projects are essential to the growth and survival of organizations. Projects create value in the form of 
improved business processes, are indispensable in the development of new products and services.

Organizational Structures

Functional organization
The classic functional organization is a hierarchy where each employee has one clear superior.
Staff members are grouped by specialty, such as production, marketing, engineering, and accounting at the top level.
Specialties may be further subdivided into focused functional units, such as mechanical and electrical engineering.
Each department in a functional organization will do its project work independently of other departments.
Project is coordinated on Function Managers level.

Project Manager's Authority is little or none.
Resource Availability is little or none.
Functional Manager manages the project budget.
Project Manager's Role is part-time.

Matrix organizations can be classified as weak, balanced, or strong depending on the relative level
of power and influence between functional and project managers.

Weak matrix organizations maintain many of the characteristics of a functional organization, 
and the role of the project manager is more of a coordinator or expediter. 
A project expediter works as staff assistant and communications coordinator. The expediter cannot personally
make or enforce decisions. Project coordinators have power to make some decisions, have some authority, and
report to a higher-level manager.

Weak matrix
Project Manager's Authority is low.
Resource Availability is low.
Functional Manager manages the project budget.
Project Manager's Role is part-time.



Strong matrix organizations have many of the characteristics of the projectized organization,
and have full-time project managers with considerable authority and full-time project administrative
staff. While the balanced matrix organization recognizes the need for a project manager, it does not provide the
project manager with the full authority over the project and project funding.

Balanced matrix
Project Manager's Authority is low to moderate.
Resource Availability is low to moderate.
Functional Manager and Project Manager manage the project budget together. 
Project Manager's Role is full-time.


Strong matrix
Project Manager's Authority is moderate to high.
Resource Availability is moderate to high.
Project Manager manages the project budget. 
Project Manager's Role is full-time.

Strong Matrix has a PMO.


In Projectized Organization project manager has a team and is fully authorized.

Projectized Organization
Project Manager's Authority is high to almost total.
Resource Availability is high to almost total.
Project Manager manages the project budget. 
Project Manager's Role is full-time.
