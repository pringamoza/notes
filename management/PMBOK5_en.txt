Ch1. Intro
PMBOK is recognized as a good practices.
"Good practice" means there is general agreement that the
application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chances of success over many projects.

"Good practice" does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all projects; the
organization and/or project management team is responsible for determining what is appropriate for any given project.


What is a Project?
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary
nature of projects indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end. The end is reached when the project’s
objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its objectives will not or cannot be met,
or when the need for the project no longer exists. A project may also be terminated if the client (customer, sponsor,
or champion) wishes to terminate the project.

What is Project Management?
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the
project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of
the 47 logically grouped project management processes, which are categorized into five Process Groups. These five
Process Groups are:
• Initiating,
• Planning,
• Executing,
• Monitoring and Controlling, and
• Closing.
