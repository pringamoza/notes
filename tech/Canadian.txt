Minimal room height is 210mm

Wooden constructions should be situated at least 200mm from the ground.

Wood supported on a concrete slab or basement columns must
be separated by a moisture barrier or the wood must be treated.

p32
Corrosion-resistant fasteners such as those
that are hot-dip galvanized or made of
stainless steel should be used with treated wood.
Regular nails or screws should not be
used and electric galvanized fasteners should
be avoided because the protective coating is
too thin for long-term service.

If preservative-treated lumber must be cut on
the job site, the cut ends should be coated with
a brush-on preservative until it is no longer
absorbed into the wood. Wear gloves when handling treated wood and
a mask when cutting it (as for the cutting of
many materials).
